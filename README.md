# Password Generator

## Webpage Function
This webpage has a password generator that allows the user to make a password using
specific criteria of their choosing.
* When the user clicks "Generate Password", the user is prompted with windows that ask for the criteria.
* The first window will ask the user for the desired password length. User must enter a number between 8 and 128.
* The user is then asked if they would like the password to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The user must pick at least one of the options.
* The password is then generated based off of the criteria the user has picked.
